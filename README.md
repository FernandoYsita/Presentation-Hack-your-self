# Fernando Abdul Espinosa Ysita  
I am 29 years old, I was born in Mexico City on April 12, 1993. I studied cinematography,  I arrived in Belgium in 2020 for family reasons and started working as a delivery man in `takceaway` (<https://www.takeaway.com/be-en/delivery/food/brussel>) . Later I applied for another company called Gorillas where I started as a delivery man and two months later I was promoted as a supervisor where this passion for technology interested me because all the work was done through applications. Unfortunately the company withdraw from the BE market and we were made redundant. For now I am unemployed but I am studying French and English at the EPFC in the afternoons and i am focused on doing a training to become a web developer in Hack your self.
